We present a system used for the public dissemination of space missions.
As two examples, the images from the New Horizons and Rosetta spacecraft are shown projected onto Pluto, Jupiter, and the 67P comet respectively. 
This technique allows the public to understand the complexity of such missions and the maneuvers performed by the spacecraft.
In addition, it provides the public with good context of the acquired images with regard to the imaging target.
