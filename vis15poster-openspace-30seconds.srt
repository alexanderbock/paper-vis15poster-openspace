00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
We present a system used for the public dissemination of space missions.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,485
As two examples, the images from the New Horizons and Rosetta spacecraft

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,800
are shown projected onto Pluto, Jupiter, and the 67P comet respectively.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,900
This technique allows the public to understand the complexity

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,886
of such missions and the maneuvers performed by the spacecraft.

6
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:26,807
In addition, it provides the public with good context of the acquired images with regard to the imaging target.
